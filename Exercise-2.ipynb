    "# Exercise 2 \n",
    "\n",
    "Exercise 2 includes four problems that you need to solve with programming, and by providing answers to questions. For each problem you need to modify the notebook by adding your own solutions. Remember to save and commit your changes locally, and push your changes to GitHub after each major change! Regular commits will help you to keep track of your changes (and revert them if needed). Pushing your work to GitHub will ensure that you don't lose any work in case your computer crashes (can happen!).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time allocation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Completing this exercise takes approximately: 6-10 hours** (based on previous year statistics). However, the time it takes can vary significantly from student to student, so we recommended that you start immediately working on the exercise to avoid issues meeting with the deadline.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Due date\n",
    "\n",
    "You should submit (push) your Exercise answers to your personal Github repository **~2.5 weeks after the release of the Exercise (i.e. submit by 23:59 on Sunday 20th November)**. \n",
    "      \n",
    "### Start your exercise in CSC Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you can start programming, you need to launch the CSC Notebook instance and clone your **personal copy of the Exercise repository** (i.e. something like `exercise-2-htenkanen`) there using Git. If you need help with this, [read the documentation on the course site](https://spatial-analytics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lessons/L1/git-basics.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Working with Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks are documents that can be used and run inside the JupyterLab programming environment (e.g. at [notebooks.csc.fi](https://notebooks.csc.fi/)) containing the computer code and rich text elements (such as text, figures, tables and links). \n",
    "\n",
    "**A couple of hints**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can **execute a cell** by clicking a given cell that you want to run and pressing <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> (or by clicking the \"Play\" button on top)\n",
    "- You can **change the cell-type** between `Markdown` (for writing text) and `Code` (for writing/executing code) from the dropdown menu above. \n",
    "\n",
    "See [**further details and help from here**](https://pythongis.org/part1/chapter-01/nb/04-using-jupyterlab.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Hints\n",
    "\n",
    "If there are general questions arising from this exercise, we will add hints to the course website under [Exercise 2 description](https://spatial-analytics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lessons/L2/exercise-2.html)."

    "1. Create spatial weights based on how the boundaries of our postal code areas touch each other. Create the weights based on the data GeoDataFrame using **Queen contiguity** and store the resulting weights into a variable `w`. For creating the spatial weights, you can use the `weights` submodule from pysal library (see [docs](https://pysal.org/libpysal/generated/libpysal.weights.Queen.html#libpysal-weights-queen)). If you need further information, we also recommend checking [chapter 4](https://geographicdata.science/book/notebooks/04_spatial_weights.html) from \"Geographic Data Science with Python\" book (Rey et al. 2023). \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Drop possible islands by using a pandas method `.drop()` (see [docs](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.drop.html)). For the sake of simplicity we just ignore the islands in our analysis. You can get the index values of the islands from the weights by calling `w.islands`. Then, reset the index of the GeoDataFrame, and recreate the weights using Queen contiguity (in a similar manner as in step 1). \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Row standardize the weights by using `w.transform` (without standardization, the spatial weights may merely reflect the number of neighbors an observation has).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Calculate the Moran's I based on the **population density** and using the spatial weights that we created in the previous step. For doing this, you can use the `Moran()` function from the pysal library, which accepts the Series of our population density column as one parameter and the weights as another, check the pysal docs for details. \n",

    "5. What is the global Moran's I for our data? \n",
    "\n",
    "6. Create a Moran plot based on our data that allows us to investigate the spatial autocorrelation visually. For doing this, you can use a `plot_moran()` -function from pysal's splot submodule. \n",
